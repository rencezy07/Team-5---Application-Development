# Stretch Features Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the three requested stretch features for the PixelLab Pro image editing application.

## üöÄ New Features Added

### 1. Batch Processing of Multiple Images üìö

**Feature Description:**
Process multiple images simultaneously with the same operation, supporting up to 10 images at once.

**How to Use:**
1. Click the "Batch" button in the toolbar
2. Drop multiple images or click to select files (max 10 images)
3. Choose an operation from the dropdown:
   - Grayscale
   - Blur
   - Sharpen
   - Edge Detection (Canny)
   - Threshold
   - Histogram Equalization
   - Denoise
4. Click "Process Images"
5. View results in a grid and download all processed images as a ZIP file

**Backend Endpoints:**
- `POST /batch_process` - Process multiple images with the same operation
- `GET /download_batch/{batch_id}` - Download batch results as ZIP

**Supported Formats:** PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP

### 2. Side-by-Side Comparison: Original vs. Processed üîÑ

**Feature Description:**
Create side-by-side comparisons showing the original image on the left and the processed version on the right with labeled headers.

**How to Use:**
1. Load an image into the editor
2. Select a processing tool from the left panel
3. Click the "Compare" button in the toolbar
4. The canvas will display a side-by-side comparison with labels

**Backend Endpoint:**
- `POST /compare` - Generate side-by-side comparison image

**Features:**
- Automatic image alignment and resizing
- Clear labels ("Original" vs "Processed (operation name)")
- Works with all available image processing operations

### 3. Export Results in Multiple Formats üì§

**Feature Description:**
Export processed images in multiple formats including PNG, JPEG, and PDF with quality controls.

**How to Use:**
1. Load and process an image
2. Click the "Export" button in the toolbar
3. Choose format:
   - **PNG** - Lossless format with transparency support
   - **JPEG** - Compressed format with quality slider (1-100)
   - **PDF** - Document format with image embedded
4. Adjust quality settings (for JPEG)
5. Click "Export" to download

**Backend Endpoint:**
- `POST /export` - Export image in specified format with quality settings

**Export Options:**
- **PNG**: Full quality, transparency support
- **JPEG**: Adjustable quality (1-100), smaller file size
- **PDF**: Basic PDF generation using PIL (fallback implementation)

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`main.py`)
- Added new imports for JSON handling, datetime, base64, zipfile
- Implemented helper function `process_single_image()` for consistent processing
- Added error handling and input validation
- File size and count limitations for batch processing
- Temporary file management for exports

### Frontend Changes

#### HTML (`index.html`)
- Added new toolbar buttons: Batch, Compare, Export
- Created modal dialogs for batch processing and export options
- Added drag-and-drop zones for multiple file selection
- Integrated JSZip library for client-side ZIP handling

#### CSS (`styles.css`)
- Added modal styling with backdrop blur effects
- Created responsive grid layouts for batch preview
- Added hover effects and transitions
- Implemented responsive design for mobile compatibility

#### JavaScript (`renderer.js`)
- Extended ImageEditor class with new methods:
  - `showBatchModal()`, `processBatch()`, `downloadBatchResults()`
  - `showComparison()` for side-by-side view
  - `showExportModal()`, `exportImage()` with format selection
- Added drag-and-drop handling for multiple files
- Implemented base64 image handling for batch results
- Added progress indicators and user feedback

## üîß Dependencies Added

### Backend
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management
- `reportlab` - PDF generation (with fallback to PIL)

### Frontend  
- `jszip` - Client-side ZIP file creation for batch downloads

## üìã Usage Examples

### Batch Processing Example
```javascript
// Select 5 images and apply blur operation
const files = [image1.jpg, image2.png, image3.jpg, image4.png, image5.jpg];
const operation = "blur";
// Results: 5 blurred images ready for download as ZIP
```

### Comparison Example
```javascript
// Load image -> Select "Sharpen" tool -> Click "Compare"
// Result: Side-by-side view showing original vs sharpened image
```

### Export Example
```javascript
// Process image -> Click "Export" -> Select "JPEG" -> Set quality to 85
// Result: High-quality JPEG download
```

## üéØ Key Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Process multiple images at once instead of one-by-one
2. **Quality Control**: Visual comparison helps assess processing results
3. **Flexibility**: Multiple export formats for different use cases
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with drag-and-drop support
5. **Professional**: ZIP downloads and PDF reports for workflows

## üîç Future Enhancements

- Enhanced PDF reports with metadata and processing history
- Additional batch operations and custom parameter sets
- Real-time preview during batch processing
- Progress bars for long-running operations
- Support for additional export formats (TIFF, WebP)
